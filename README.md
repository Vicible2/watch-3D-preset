### 3D Animation in your browser
***


In todays' watch I will give a quick video guide/workshop:

Getting started:
* Loading your first 3D model into your website
* Add basic lighting
* Add a simple animation (give it your own spin!)

I will include a textual guide once my presentation has finished, so you can all try it out and experiment further with three.js!

I hope you enjoyed the watch,

Good luck, and have fun!
